# Hi I'm Tash
### I will be an ambitious website builder project made with ðŸ’• and Next.js, React & Firebase

## Core Ideas
The main goal of Tash is to make a simple website builder / CMS that is made with modern tooling and features all of the benefits of the modern web such as:
+ Single page application
+ Code splitting
+ Server Side Rendering
+ Service workers
+ Progressive Web App tech

The idea is to make a website builder interface which is simple with a key focus on the building blocks of the page. These blocks will include popular website features such as:
+ Cover images
+ Portfolio
+ Testimonials
+ Instagram feed

Tash is strongly influenced by Wordpress as a CMS and Wix as a website builder (which are fantastic pieces of software) but aims to be far simpler, faster and easier by using modern web tech.

## Who is Tash for?
Tash is aimed at Web Developers who wan't a faster way to create simple websites. For me personally I want to be able to spin up a site in 5 minutes, spend a few hours tweaking the design and content and then focus on the components themselves. 

## Todo's ðŸ¤¯
+ Create some basic components
+ Block generator HOC
+ Site customzier navbar
+ Customizer controls -> colors, fonts, spacings etc
+ Firebase integration & authentication

## Getting Involved
This will be my first big Open Source Project so I am going to need a lot of help! Please raise a PR and help get involved.
